      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I will talk about how I am a enthusiastic learner of all things technology, especially in the Cybersecurity field on the home page. I have had all type of jobs from working construction to a call center job. Through all of my experience, I have truly gained a love curiosity for the information technology. The page will also offer a description of who I am. Through that information, those that visit the site will see what type of person I am and my values. There will be a picture that shows off my face so that those that visit the site will know what I look like. I will also have pictures of my family (whether it is my parents and siblings or my significant other depends). I want those that see my site to see that I am human and not just another number on a screen. There will be a contact me section at the bottom. This page will list all my contact information. It will also have text areas to put the persons name, email address and a message in which they want to share with me. To the right side of the contact me boxes, I will have the links to all the social media that I check and use so that the people can contact me on those if they would like.

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        The second page will cover the content of my portfolio. I will have a link to my github account. Below that link, I will have a list of different projects that I have on the account and ones that I am comfortable sharing with others. I want all those that see them to see someone that is passionate in the field of information technology and programming. This page will also show those who visit it what type of projects I am interested in and what I like to challenge myself to do. This page will also be in a card format, with each card having information about the projects listed. Each project shared on the website will have its respective link to its github page, a image of a portion of what the portion looks like from the users perspective, and a short description of what the project is what it accomplishes. These tiles that have all the project info will show those that visit this page that I have put in work into my projects and I care about the type of projects I do.

      </ul>
      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        The third page will be a page that lays out my resume in a more in depth format. I will display the work experience, education, service projects and leadership roles I have done. All the information about each item will be not be long but have more details about responsibilities in each role that I have had and have the necessary information on what I performed in each event/job. With my education, I will include information about certificates earned and what I gained from each certificate. This page will show more information for those that are curious about more of my qualifications to perform a job or be involved in the information technology field. I will have only one link to Linkedin so that I won’t need to list all of my job experiences, only the ones that seem to be the most important to the information technology field. I will also talk more about how I came to gain a love for the information technology field. I will lay out skills and the proficiency I have with each one, showing how far I have come on my professional journey.
